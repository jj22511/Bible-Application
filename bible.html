		<!--GENESIS-->
					<div class="genread"><h1><strong><center>GENESIS</center></strong></h1>  <strong>1.</strong> In the beginning God created * the heaven and the earth.<br><strong>2.</strong> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. <br><strong>3.</strong> And God said , Let there be light: and there was light. <br><strong>4.</strong> And God saw * the light, that it was good: and God divided * the light from the darkness.<br><strong>5.</strong> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. <br><strong>6.</strong> And God said , Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. <br><strong>7.</strong> And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. <br><strong>8.</strong> And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. <br><strong>9.</strong> And God said , Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear : and it was so. <br><strong>10.</strong> And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. <br><strong>11.</strong> And God said , Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. <br><strong>12.</strong> And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. <br><strong>13.</strong> And the evening and the morning were the third day. <br><strong>14.</strong> And God said , Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: <br><strong>15.</strong> And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. <br><strong>16.</strong> And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. <br><strong>17.</strong> And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, <br><strong>18.</strong> And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. <br><strong>19.</strong> And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. <br><strong>20.</strong> And God said , Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. <br><strong>21.</strong> And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth , which the waters brought forth abundantly , after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. <br><strong>22.</strong> And God blessed them, saying , Be fruitful , and multiply , and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. <br><strong>23.</strong> And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. <br><strong>24.</strong> And God said , Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. <br><strong>25.</strong> And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. <br><strong>26.</strong> And God said , Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. <br><strong>27.</strong> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. <br><strong>28.</strong> And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth, and subdue it : and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. <br><strong>29.</strong> And God said , Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. <br><strong>30.</strong> And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life *, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. <br><strong>31.</strong> And God saw every thing that he had made , and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</div>

					<div class="exoread"><h1><strong><center>EXODUS</center></strong></h1><strong>1.</strong> Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.<br><strong>3.</strong> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,<br><strong>4.</strong> Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.<br><strong>5.</strong> And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.<br><strong>6.</strong> And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.<br><strong>7.</strong> And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.<br><strong>8.</strong> Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.<br><strong>9.</strong> And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:<br><strong>10.</strong> Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.<br><strong>11.</strong> Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.<br><strong>12.</strong> But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.<br><strong>13.</strong> And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:<br><strong>14.</strong> And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.<br><strong>15.</strong> And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:<br><strong>16.</strong> And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.<br><strong>17.</strong> But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.<br><strong>18.</strong> And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?<br><strong>19.</strong> And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.<br><strong>20.</strong> Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.<br><strong>21.</strong> And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.<br><strong>22.</strong> And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.<br></div>

		<!--DEUTORONOMY-->
					<div class="deuread"><h1><strong><center>DEUTORONOMY</center></strong></h1><strong>1.</strong> These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.<br><strong>2.</strong>  (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)<br><strong>3.</strong>  And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them;<br><strong>4.</strong>  After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:<br><strong>5.</strong>  On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,<br><strong>6.</strong>  The Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:<br><strong>7.</strong>  Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.<br><strong>8.</strong>  Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.<br><strong>9.</strong>  And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:<br><strong>10.</strong>  The Lord your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.<br><strong>11.</strong>  (The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)<br><strong>12.</strong>  How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?<br><strong>13.</strong>  Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.<br><strong>14.</strong>  And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.<br><strong>15.</strong>  So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.<br><strong>16.</strong>  And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.<br><strong>17.</strong>  Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.<br><strong>18.</strong>  And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.<br><strong>19.</strong>  And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.<br><strong>20.</strong> And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the Lord our God doth give unto us.<br><strong>21.</strong>  Behold, the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.<br><strong>22.</strong>  And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.<br><strong>23.</strong>  And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:<br><strong>24.</strong>  And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.<br><strong>25.</strong>  And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the Lord our God doth give us.<br><strong>26.</strong> Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God:<br><strong>27.</strong>  And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the Lord hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.<br><strong>28.</strong>  Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.<br><strong>29.</strong>  Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.<br><strong>30.</strong>  The Lord your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;<br><strong>31.</strong>  And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the Lord thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.<br><strong>32.</strong>  Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God,<br><strong>33.</strong>  Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.<br><strong>34.</strong>  And the Lord heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,<br><strong>35.</strong>  Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers.<br><strong>36.</strong>  Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the Lord.<br><strong>37.</strong>  Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.<br><strong>38.</strong>  But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.<br><strong>39.</strong>  Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.<br><strong>40.</strong>  But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.<br><strong>41.</strong>  Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the Lord, we will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.<br><strong>42.</strong>  And the Lord said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.<br><strong>43.</strong>  So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord, and went presumptuously up into the hill.<br><strong>44.</strong> And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.<br><strong>45.</strong> And ye returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.<br><strong>46.</strong> So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.<br></div>

Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.<br><strong>10.</strong>  Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,<br><strong>11.</strong>  Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it.<br><strong>12.</strong>  And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,<br><strong>13.</strong>  Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, The Lord your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.<br><strong>14.</strong>  Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;<br><strong>15.</strong>  Until the Lord have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the Lord your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the Lord's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.<br><strong>16.</strong>  And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.<br><strong>17.</strong>  According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.<br><strong>18.</strong>  Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.<br></div>

					<div class="judgread"><h1><strong><center>JUDGES</center></strong></h1>  <strong>1.</strong> Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the Lord, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?<br><strong>2.</strong> And the Lord said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.<br><strong>3.</strong> And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.<br><strong>4.</strong> And Judah went up; and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.<br><strong>5.</strong> And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.<br><strong>6.</strong> But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.<br><strong>7.</strong> And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.<br><strong>8.</strong> Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.<br><strong>9.</strong> And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.<br><strong>10.</strong> And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.<br><strong>11.</strong> And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:<br><strong>12.</strong> And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.<br><strong>13.</strong> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.<br><strong>14.</strong> And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?<br><strong>15.</strong> And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.<br><strong>16.</strong> And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.<br><strong>17.</strong> And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.<br><strong>18.</strong> Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.<br><strong>19.</strong> And the Lord was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.<br><strong>20.</strong> And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.<br><strong>21.</strong> And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.<br><strong>22.</strong> And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the Lord was with them.<br><strong>23.</strong> And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)<br><strong>24.</strong> And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.<br><strong>25.</strong> And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.<br><strong>26.</strong> And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day.<br><strong>27.</strong> Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.<br><strong>28.</strong> And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.<br><strong>29.</strong> Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.<br><strong>30.</strong> Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.<br><strong>31.</strong> Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:<br><strong>32.</strong> But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.<br><strong>33.</strong> Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.<br><strong>34.</strong> And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:<br><strong>35.</strong> But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.<br><strong>36.</strong> And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.<br></div>

					<div class="rutread"><h1><strong><center>RUTH</center></strong></h1> <strong>1.</strong> Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.<br><strong>2.</strong> And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.<br><strong>3.</strong> And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.<br><strong>4.</strong> And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.<br><strong>5.</strong> And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.<br><strong>6.</strong> Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread.<br><strong>7.</strong> Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.<br><strong>8.</strong> And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the Lord deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.<br><strong>9.</strong> The Lord grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.<br><strong>10.</strong> And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.<br><strong>11.</strong> And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?<br><strong>12.</strong> Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;<br><strong>13.</strong> Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.<br><strong>14.</strong> And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.<br><strong>15.</strong> And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.<br><strong>16.</strong> And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:<br><strong>17.</strong> Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.<br><strong>18.</strong> When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.<br><strong>19.</strong> So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?<br><strong>20.</strong> And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.<br><strong>21.</strong> I went out full and the Lord hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the Lord hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?<br><strong>22.</strong> So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest. <br></div>

					<div class="Isamread"><h1><strong><center>1 SAMUEL</center></strong></h1><strong>1.</strong> Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:<br><strong>2.</strong> And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.<br><strong>3.</strong> And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord, were there.<br><strong>4.</strong> And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:<br><strong>5.</strong> But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the Lord had shut up her womb.<br><strong>6.</strong> And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the Lord had shut up her womb.<br><strong>7.</strong> And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the Lord, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.<br><strong>8.</strong> Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?<br><strong>9.</strong> So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the Lord.<br><strong>10.</strong> And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord, and wept sore.<br><strong>11.</strong> And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.<br><strong>12.</strong> And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli marked her mouth.<br><strong>13.</strong> Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.<br><strong>14.</strong> And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.<br><strong>15.</strong> And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord.<br><strong>16.</strong> Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.<br><strong>17.</strong> Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.<br><strong>18.</strong> And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.<br><strong>19.</strong> And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the Lord, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her.<br><strong>20.</strong> Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the Lord.<br><strong>21.</strong> And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the Lord the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.<br><strong>22.</strong> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord, and there abide for ever.<br><strong>23.</strong> And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the Lord establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.<br><strong>24.</strong> And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh: and the child was young.<br><strong>25.</strong> And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.<br><strong>26.</strong> And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord.<br><strong>27.</strong> For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him:<br><strong>28.</strong> Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord.

					<div class="IIsamread"><h1><strong><center>2 SAMUEL</center></strong></h1> <strong>1.</strong> Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;<br><strong>2.</strong> It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.<br><strong>3.</strong> And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.<br><strong>4.</strong> And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.<br><strong>5.</strong> And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?<br><strong>6.</strong> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.<br><strong>7.</strong> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.<br><strong>8.</strong> And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.<br><strong>9.</strong> He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.<br><strong>10.</strong> So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.<br><strong>11.</strong> Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:<br><strong>12.</strong> And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.<br><strong>13.</strong> And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.<br><strong>14.</strong> And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the Lord's anointed?<br><strong>15.</strong> And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.<br><strong>16.</strong> And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the Lord's anointed.<br><strong>17.</strong> And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:<br><strong>18.</strong> (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)<br><strong>19.</strong> The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!<br><strong>20.</strong> Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.<br><strong>21.</strong> Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.<br><strong>22.</strong> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.<br><strong>23.</strong> Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.<br><strong>24.</strong> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.<br><strong>25.</strong> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.<br><strong>26.</strong> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.<br><strong>27.</strong> How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!<br></div>

					<div class="Ikingread"><h1><strong><center>1 KINGS</center></strong></h1> <strong>1.</strong> Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.<br><strong>2.</strong> Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.<br><strong>3.</strong> So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.<br><strong>4.</strong> And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.<br><strong>5.</strong> Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.<br><strong>6.</strong> And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.<br><strong>7.</strong> And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.<br><strong>8.</strong> But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.<br><strong>9.</strong> And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:<br><strong>10.</strong> But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.<br><strong>11.</strong> Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?<br><strong>12.</strong> Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.<br><strong>13.</strong> Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?<br><strong>14.</strong> Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.<br><strong>15.</strong> And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.<br><strong>16.</strong> And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?<br><strong>17.</strong> And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the Lord thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.<br><strong>18.</strong> And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:<br><strong>19.</strong> And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.<br><strong>20.</strong> And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.<br><strong>21.</strong> Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.<br><strong>22.</strong> And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.<br><strong>23.</strong> And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.<br><strong>24.</strong> And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?<br><strong>25.</strong> For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.<br><strong>26.</strong> But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.<br><strong>27.</strong> Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?<br><strong>28.</strong> Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.<br><strong>29.</strong> And the king sware, and said, As the Lord liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,<br><strong>30.</strong> Even as I sware unto thee by the Lord God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.<br><strong>31.</strong> Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.<br><strong>32.</strong> And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.<br><strong>33.</strong> The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:<br><strong>34.</strong> And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.<br><strong>35.</strong> Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.<br><strong>36.</strong> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the Lord God of my lord the king say so too.<br><strong>37.</strong> As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.<br><strong>38.</strong> So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.<br><strong>39.</strong> And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.<br><strong>40.</strong> And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.<br><strong>41.</strong> And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?<br><strong>42.</strong> And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.<br><strong>43.</strong> And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.<br><strong>44.</strong> And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:<br><strong>45.</strong> And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.<br><strong>46.</strong> And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.<br><strong>47.</strong> And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.<br><strong>48.</strong> And also thus said the king, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.<br><strong>49.</strong>And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.<br><strong>50.</strong> And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.<br><strong>51.</strong> And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.<br><strong>52.</strong> And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.<br><strong>53.</strong> So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.

And Elijah departed.<br><strong>5.</strong> And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?<br><strong>6.</strong> And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.<br><strong>7.</strong> And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?<br><strong>8.</strong> And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.<br><strong>9.</strong> Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.<br><strong>10.</strong> And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.<br><strong>11.</strong> Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.<br><strong>12.</strong> And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.<br><strong>13.</strong> And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.<br><strong>14.</strong> Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.<br><strong>15.</strong> And the angel of the Lord said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.<br><strong>16.</strong> And he said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.<br><strong>17.</strong> So he died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.<br><strong>18.</strong> Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?<br></div>

And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.<br><strong>10.</strong> See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.<br><strong>11.</strong> Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.<br><strong>12.</strong> Then said the Lord unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.<br><strong>13.</strong> And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north.<br><strong>14.</strong> Then the Lord said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.<br><strong>15.</strong> For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the Lord; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.<br><strong>16.</strong> And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.<br><strong>17.</strong> Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.<br><strong>18.</strong> For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.<br><strong>19.</strong> And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.<br></div>

O Lord, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.<br><strong>10.</strong> The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.<br><strong>11.</strong> All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O Lord, and consider; for I am become vile.<br><strong>12.</strong> Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.<br><strong>13.</strong> From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.<br><strong>14.</strong> The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.<br><strong>15.</strong> The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.<br><strong>16.</strong> For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.<br><strong>17.</strong> Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the Lord hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.<br><strong>18.</strong> The Lord is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.<br><strong>19.</strong> I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.<br><strong>20.</strong> Behold, O Lord; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.<br><strong>21.</strong> They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.<br><strong>22.</strong> Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.<br></div>

And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.<br><strong>6.</strong> And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.<br><strong>7.</strong> And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.<br><strong>8.</strong> And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.<br><strong>9.</strong> Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.<br><strong>10.</strong> As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.<br><strong>11.</strong> Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.<br><strong>12.</strong> And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.<br><strong>13.</strong>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.<br><strong>14.</strong> And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.<br><strong>15.</strong> Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.<br><strong>16.</strong> The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.<br><strong>17.</strong> When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.<br><strong>18.</strong> As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.<br><strong>19.</strong> And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.<br><strong>20.</strong> Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.<br><strong>21.</strong> When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.<br><strong>22.</strong> And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.<br><strong>23.</strong> And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.<br><strong>24.</strong> And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.<br><strong>25.</strong> And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.<br><strong>26.</strong> And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.<br><strong>27.</strong> And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.<br><strong>28.</strong> As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.<br></div>

In that ye say, The table of the Lord is contemptible.<br><strong>8.</strong> And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the Lord of hosts.<br><strong>9.</strong> And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the Lord of hosts.<br><strong>10.</strong> Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.<br><strong>11.</strong> For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts.<br><strong>12.</strong> But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the Lord is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.<br><strong>13.</strong> Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the Lord of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the Lord.<br><strong>14.</strong> But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.  <br></div>
<!--NEW TESTAMENT-->
		<!--MATTHEW-->
					<div class="matread"><h1><strong><center>MATTHEW</center></strong></h1>  <strong>1.</strong> The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.<br><strong>2.</strong> Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;<br><strong>3.</strong> And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;<br><strong>4.</strong> And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;<br><strong>5.</strong> And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;<br><strong>6.</strong> And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;<br><strong>7.</strong> And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;<br><strong>8.</strong> And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;<br><strong>9.</strong> And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;<br><strong>10.</strong> And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;<br><strong>11.</strong> And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:<br><strong>12.</strong> And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;<br><strong>13.</strong> And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;<br><strong>14.</strong> And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;<br><strong>15.</strong> And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;<br><strong>16.</strong> And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.<br><strong>17.</strong> So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.<br><strong>18.</strong> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.<br><strong>19.</strong> Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.<br><strong>20.</strong> But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.<br><strong>21.</strong> And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.<br><strong>22.</strong> Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,<br><strong>23.</strong> Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.<br><strong>24.</strong> Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:<br><strong>25.</strong> And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</div>

		<!--MARK-->
					<div class="marread"><h1><strong><center>MARK</center></strong></h1>1. The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;<br>2. As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.<br>3. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.<br>4. John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.<br>5. And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.<br>6. And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;<br>7. And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.<br>8. I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.<br>9. And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.<br>10. And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:<br>11. And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<br>12. And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.<br>13. And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.<br>14. Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,<br>15. And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.<br>16. Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.<br>17. And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.<br>18. And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.<br>19. And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.<br>20. And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.<br>21. And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.<br>22. And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.<br>23. And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,<br>24. Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.<br>25. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.<br>26. And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.<br>27. And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.<br>28. And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.<br>29. And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.<br>30. But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.<br>31. And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.<br>32. And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.<br>33. And all the city was gathered together at the door.<br>34. And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.<br>35. And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.<br>36. And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.<br>37. And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.<br>38. And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.<br>39. And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.<br>40. And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.<br>41. And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.<br>42. And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.<br>43. And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;<br>44. And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.<br>45. But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.<br></div>
		
		<!--LUKE-->
					<div class="lukread"><h1><strong><center>LUKE</center></strong></h1>1. Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,<br>2. Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;<br>3. It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,<br>4. That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.<br>5. There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.<br>6. And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.<br>7. And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.<br>8. And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,<br>9. According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.<br>10. And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.<br>11. And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.<br>12. And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.<br>13. But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.<br>14. And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.<br>15. For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.<br>16. And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.<br>17. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.<br>18. And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.<br>19. And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.<br>20. And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.<br>21. And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.<br>22. And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.<br>23. And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.<br>24. And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,<br>25. Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.<br>26. And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,<br>27. To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.<br>28. And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.<br>29. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.<br>30. And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.<br>31. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.<br>32. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:<br>33. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.<br>34. Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?<br>35. And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.<br>36. And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.<br>37. For with God nothing shall be impossible.<br>38. And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.<br>39. And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;<br>40. And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.<br>41. And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:<br>42. And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.<br>43. And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?<br>44. For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.<br>45. And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.<br>46. And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,<br>47. And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.<br>48. For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.<br>49. For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.<br>50. And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.<br>51. He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br>52. He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.<br>53. He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br>54. He hath helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;<br>55. As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.<br>56. And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.<br>57. Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.<br>58. And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.<br>59. And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.<br>60. And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.<br>61. And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.<br>62. And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.<br>63. And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.<br>64. And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.<br>65. And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.<br>66. And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.<br>67. And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,<br>68. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,<br>69. And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;<br>70. As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:<br>71. That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;<br>72. To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;<br>73. The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,<br>74. That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,<br>75. In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.<br>76. And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;<br>77. To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,<br>78. Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,<br>79. To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.<br>80. And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.<br></div>
		
		<!--JOHN-->
					<div class="johnread"><h1><strong><center>JOHN</center></strong></h1> 1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br>2. The same was in the beginning with God.<br>3. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.<br>4. In him was life; and the life was the light of men.<br>5. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.<br>6. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.<br>7. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.<br>8. He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.<br>9. That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.<br>10. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.<br>11. He came unto his own, and his own received him not.<br>12. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:<br>13. Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.<br>14. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.<br>15. John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.<br>16. And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.<br>17. For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.<br>18. No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.<br>19. And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?<br>20. And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.<br>21. And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.<br>22. Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?<br>23. He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.<br>24. And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.<br>25. And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?<br>26. John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;<br>27. He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.<br>28. These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.<br>29. The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.<br>30. This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.<br>31. And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.<br>32. And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.<br>33. And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.<br>34. And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.<br>35. Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;<br>36. And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!<br>37. And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.<br>38. Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?<br>39. He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.<br>40. One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.<br>41. He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.<br>42. And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.<br>43. The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.<br>44. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.<br>45. Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.<br>46. And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.<br>47. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!<br>48. Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.<br>49. Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.<br>50. Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.<br>51. And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.<br></div>	
		
		<!--ACTS-->
					<div class="actread"><h1><strong><center>ACTS</center></strong></h1> 1. The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,<br>2. Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:<br>3. To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:<br>4. And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.<br>5. For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.<br>6. When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?<br>7. And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.<br>8. But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.<br>9. And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.<br>10. And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;<br>11. Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.<br>12. Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.<br>13. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.<br>14. These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.<br>15. And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)<br>16. Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.<br>17. For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.<br>18. Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.<br>19. And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.<br>20. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.<br>21. Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,<br>22. Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.<br>23. And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.<br>24. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,<br>25. That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.<br>26. And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.<br></div>

To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>8. First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.<br>9. For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;<br>10. Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.<br>11. For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;<br>12. That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.<br>13. Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.<br>14. I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.<br>15. So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.<br>16. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.<br>17. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.<br>18. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;<br>19. Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.<br>20. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:<br>21. Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.<br>22. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,<br>23. And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.<br>24. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:<br>25. Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.<br>26. For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:<br>27. And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.<br>28. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;<br>29. Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,<br>30. Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,<br>31. Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:<br>32. Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.<br></div>

Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's:<br>3. Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>4. I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;<br>5. That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;<br>6. Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:<br>7. So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:<br>8. Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>9. God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>10. Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.<br>11. For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.<br>12. Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.<br>13. Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?<br>14. I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;<br>15. Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.<br>16. And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.<br>17. For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.<br>18. For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.<br>19. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.<br>20. Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?<br>21. For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.<br>22. For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:<br>23. But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;<br>24. But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.<br>25. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.<br>26. For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:<br>27. But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;<br>28. And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:<br>29. That no flesh should glory in his presence.<br>30. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:<br>31. That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.<br></div>

Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>3. Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;<br>4. Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.<br>5. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.<br>6. And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.<br>7. And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.<br>8. For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:<br>9. But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:<br>10. Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;<br>11. Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.<br>12. For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.<br>13. For we write none other things unto you, that what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;<br>14. As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.<br>15. And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;<br>16. And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.<br>17. When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?<br>18. But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.<br>19. For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.<br>20. For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.<br>21. Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;<br>22. Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.<br>23. Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.<br>24. Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.<br></div>

And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:<br>3. Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>4. Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:<br>5. To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br>6. I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:<br>7. Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.<br>8. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.<br>9. As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.<br>10. For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.<br>11. But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.<br>12. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.<br>13. For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:<br>14. And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.<br>15. But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,<br>16. To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:<br>17. Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.<br>18. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.<br>19. But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.<br>20. Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.<br>21. Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;<br>22. And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:<br>23. But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.<br>24. And they glorified God in me.<br></div>

To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.<br>7. In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;<br>8. Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;<br>9. Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:<br>10. That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:<br>11. In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:<br>12. That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.<br>13. In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,<br>14. Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.<br>15. Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,<br>16. Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;<br>17. That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:<br>18. The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,<br>19. And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,<br>20. Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,<br>21. Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:<br>22.

Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,<br>5. For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;<br>6. Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:<br>7. Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.<br>8. For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.<br>9. And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;<br>10. That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.<br>11. Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.<br>12. But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;<br>13. So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;<br>14. And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.<br>15. Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:<br>16. The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:<br>17. But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.<br>18. What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.<br>19. For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,<br>20. According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.<br>21. For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.<br>22. But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.<br>23. For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:<br>24. Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.<br>25. And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;<br>26. That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.<br>27. Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;<br>28. And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.<br>29. For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;<br>30. Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.<br></div>

As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,<br>4. Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.<br>5.

Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.<br>8. But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;<br>9. Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,<br>10. For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;<br>11. According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.<br>12. And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;<br>13. Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.<br>14. And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.<br>15. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.<br>16. Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.<br>17. Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br>18.

Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;<br>9. Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,<br>10. But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:<br>11. Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.<br>12. For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.<br>13. Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.<br>14. That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.<br>15. This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.<br>16. The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:<br>17. But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.<br>18. The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well. <br></div>	
		<!--TITUS-->
					<div class="titread"><h1><strong><center>TITUS</center></strong></h1> 1. Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;<br>2. In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;<br>3. But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;<br>4. To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.<br>5. For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:<br>6. If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.<br>7. For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;<br>8. But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;<br>9. Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.<br>10. For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:<br>11. Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.<br>12. One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, the Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.<br>13. This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;<br>14. Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.<br>15. Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.<br>16. They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.<br></div>
		<!--PHILEMON-->
					<div class="phileread"><h1><strong><center>PHILEMON</center></strong></h1> 1. Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,<br>2. And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:<br>3. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br>4. I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,<br>5. Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;<br>6. That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.<br>7. For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.<br>8. Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,<br>9. Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.<br>10. I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:<br>11. Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:<br>12. Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:<br>13. Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:<br>14. But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.<br>15. For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;<br>16. Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?<br>17. If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.<br>18. If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;<br>19. I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.<br>20. Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.<br>21. Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.<br>22. But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.<br>23. There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;<br>24. Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.<br>25. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.<br></div>

		<!--HEBREWS-->
					<div class="hebread"><h1><strong><center>HEBREWS</center></strong></h1> 1. God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,<br>2. Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;<br>3. Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:<br>4. Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.<br>5. For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?<br>6. And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.<br>7. And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.<br>8. But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.<br>9. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.<br>10. And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:<br>11. They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;<br>12. And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.<br>13. But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?<br>14. Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.<br></div>	
		<!--JAMES-->
					<div class="jamread"><h1><strong><center>JAMES</center></strong></h1> 1. James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.<br>2. My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;<br>3. Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.<br>4. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.<br>5. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.<br>6. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.<br>7. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.<br>8. A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.<br>9. Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:<br>10. But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.<br>11. For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.<br>12. Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.<br>13. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:<br>14. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.<br>15. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.<br>16. Do not err, my beloved brethren.<br>17. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.<br>18. Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.<br>19. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:<br>20. For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.<br>21. Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.<br>22. But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.<br>23. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:<br>24. For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.<br>25. But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.<br>26. If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.<br>27. Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.<br></div>

					<div class="Ipetread"><h1><strong><center>1 PETER</center></strong></h1> 1. Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,<br>2. Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.<br>3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,<br>4. To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,<br>5. Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.<br>6. Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:<br>7. That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:<br>8. Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:<br>9. Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.<br>10. Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:<br>11. Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.<br>12. Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.<br>13. Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;<br>14. As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:<br>15. But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;<br>16. Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.<br>17. And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:<br>18. Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;<br>19. But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:<br>20. Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,<br>21. Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.<br>22. Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:<br>23. Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.<br>24. For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:<br>25. But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.<br></div>
		<!--2 PETER-->
					<div class="IIpetread"><h1><strong><center>2 PETER</center></strong></h1> 1. Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:<br>2. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,<br>3. According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:<br>4. Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.<br>5. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;<br>6. And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;<br>7. And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.<br>8. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>9. But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.<br>10. Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:<br>11. For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.<br>12. Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.<br>13. Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;<br>14. Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.<br>15. Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.<br>16. For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.<br>17. For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<br>18. And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.<br>19. We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:<br>20. Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.<br>21. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.<br></div>

(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)<br>3. That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.<br>4. And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.<br>5. This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.<br>6. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:<br>7. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.<br>8. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.<br>9. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>10. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.<br></div>

For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.<br>3. Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.<br>4. I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.<br>5. And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.<br>6. And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.<br>7. For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.<br>8. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.<br>9. Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.<br>10. If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:<br>11. For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.<br>12. Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.<br>13.

For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.<br>4. I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.<br>5. Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;<br>6. Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:<br>7. Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.<br>8. We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.<br>9. I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.<br>10. Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.<br>11. Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.<br>12. Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.<br>13. I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:<br>14. But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee.

Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.<br>3. Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.<br>4. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>5. I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.<br>6. And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.<br>7. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.<br>8. Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.<br>9. Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.<br>10. But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.<br>11. Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.<br>12. These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;<br>13. Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.<br>14. And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,<br>15. To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.<br>16. These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.<br>17. But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>18. How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.<br>19. These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.<br>20. But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,<br>21. Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.<br>22. And of some have compassion, making a difference:<br>23. And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.<br>24. Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,<br>25. To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.<br></div>

Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.<br>3. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.<br>4. John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;<br>5. And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,<br>6. And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.<br>7. Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.<br>8. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.<br>9. I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.<br>10. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,<br>11. Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.<br>12. And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;<br>13. And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.<br>14. His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;<br>15. And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.<br>16. And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.<br>17. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:<br>18. I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.<br>19. Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;<br>20. The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.<br></div>
